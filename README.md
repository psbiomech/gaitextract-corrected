Updates and corrections to GaitExtract171 by Tim Dorn. This is a continual work in progress, updated as needed by me.

GaitExtract is a Matlab package originally written by Tim Dorn for his PhD to extract C3D data taken at the Biomotion Laboratory and the AIS indoor track for use in OpenSim. It uses C3Dserver to perform the bulk of the work.
